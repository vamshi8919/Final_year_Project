    <h2 class="section-title">Common Diseases</h2>
    <p>Mango crops can be affected by many diseases, including anthracnose, powdery mildew, die back, and red rust.</p>
    
    <h3>Anthracnose</h3>
    <p>A fungal disease that can affect mango trees in the field and after harvest. Symptoms include blackish-brown specks on flowers and peduncles, and small black spots on panicles.</p>
    
    <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
    <p>A fungal disease that affects mango trees, panicles, fruits, and leaves. It is caused by the plant pathogen <i>Oidium mangiferae</i>. Mango is the only known host of this disease.</p>
    
    <h3>Other Diseases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Die back:</b> Can be controlled by pruning diseased twigs and spraying with copper oxychloride.</li>
        <li><b>Red rust:</b> Causes defoliation of leaves and reduces photosynthetic activity.</li>
        <li><b>Sooty mold:</b> Common in orchards where mealy bugs, scale insects, and hoppers are not controlled.</li>
        <li><b>Mango seed weevil:</b> A pest that lays eggs in mango fruit, causing damage.</li>
        <li><b>Nutritional deficiencies:</b> Potassium deficiency can cause leaf margins to scorch, starting from the tip downwards.</li>

        <li><b>Movento:</b> A pesticide that controls mango scale pests.</li>
        <li><b>Copper fungicides:</b> Used to treat mango scab and anthracnose.</li>
