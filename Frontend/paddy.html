        <h1>Paddy Plant Uses</h1>
        <p>Paddy, or rice, has many uses, including food, fuel, and animal feed.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flaked rice:</strong> Used to make a variety of foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Sake:</strong> A Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice flour:</strong> Used to make noodles and breakfast cereals.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown rice:</strong> A whole grain that can help with weight management and digestion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fuel</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paddy husk:</strong> Used as fuel and in brick making.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice hulls:</strong> Used as fuel, packing material, and in fertilizer manufacturing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Animal Feed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bran:</strong> Used as cattle feed.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice polish:</strong> A finely powdered bran and starch used as livestock feed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Uses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Straw:</strong> Used as livestock bedding, for thatching roofs, and for making mats, garments, and broomstraws.</li>
            <li><strong>Bran oil:</strong> Used as an edible oil, in the textile industry, and in the leather industry.</li>
            <li><strong>Bran wax:</strong> Used in the chocolate and lipstick industries.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population. It's also important to millions of small farmers and the people who work on their farms.</p>

        <h2>Common Diseases</h2>
        <p>Paddy crops are susceptible to many diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These diseases can reduce yields and the quality of the grain.</p>
        <h3>Common Diseases of Paddy Crops</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sheath blight:</strong> A disease that causes white, cottony growth on the leaves and leaf sheaths, which eventually turn brown and die. It can also cause lesions on the stem and empty grains.</li>
            <li><strong>Blast disease:</strong> A disease that causes blast-like lesions on the leaves, stem, and grains. It spreads quickly and can cause huge losses if not treated promptly.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown spot:</strong> A disease that causes small dark brown spots on the leaves. It can affect the yield and milling quality of the grain.</li>
            <li><strong>Sheath rot:</strong> A disease that reduces grain yield by retarding or aborting panicle emergence.</li>
            <li><strong>Bacterial leaf blight:</strong> A disease that is considered a major threat to rice production because of its wide spread and destructiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Stem rot:</strong> A disease that causes premature death and lodging of the plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Tungro disease:</strong> A disease that is one of the most damaging and destructive diseases of rice in South and Southeast Asia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pesticides and Fertilizers</h2>
        <p>Pesticides used for paddy crops in India include herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides.</p>

            <li><strong>Affinity Herbicide:</strong> A herbicide used for rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Critel Herbicide:</strong> A herbicide used for rice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fungicides</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cilpyrox Fungicide:</strong> A fungicide used for rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Gezeko Fungicide:</strong> A fungicide used for rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Polyram:</strong> A broad spectrum contact fungicide that protects against a wide range of diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Fenamidone:</strong> A strobilurin used against rice diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Kresoxim methyl:</strong> A strobilurin used against rice diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Pyraclostrobin:</strong> A strobilurin used against rice diseases.</li>
