        <h2>Common Diseases</h2>
        <p>Coconut trees can get many diseases, including bud rot, leaf rot, stem bleeding, and root disease.</p>
        <h3>Bud Rot</h3>
        <p>The most common disease of coconut trees caused by Phytophthora palmivora, a chromistan. Can cause black spots on leaves, which fall off. If left untreated, can lead to no or limited yield.</p>
        <h3>Leaf Rot</h3>
        <p>Disfigures leaves and reduces yield and appears as water-soaked lesions on leaves.</p>
        <h3>Stem Bleeding</h3>
        <p>The stem may bleed a reddish-brown liquid that decays the tree's tissues.</p>
        <h3>Root Disease</h3>
        <p>Leaves may turn yellow and bend abnormally.</p>
        <h3>Other Coconut Diseases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethal Yellowing:</strong> The most destructive disease of coconut palms.</li>
            <li><strong>Ganoderma Wilt:</strong> A devastating disease that affects the production and productivity of palms.</li>
            <li><strong>Coconut Mites:</strong> An economically devastating mite that can destroy up to 60% of coconut production.</li>
            <li><strong>Coconut Root (Wilt):</strong> A non-lethal disease that affects the roots of coconut palms.</li>
            <li><strong>Kalimantan Wilt:</strong> A disease associated with the presence of a phytoplasma.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fungi cause most of these diseases.</p>
