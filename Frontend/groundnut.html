        </ul>

        <h2>Soil Improvement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Organic manure:</strong> Groundnuts can be used as organic manure to improve soil fertility.</li>
            <li><strong>Nitrogen fixation:</strong> Groundnuts improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Uses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooking oil:</strong> Groundnut oil is used for cooking, frying, and salad dressings.</li>
            <li><strong>Margarine:</strong> Made from groundnut oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmetic products:</strong> Made from groundnut oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Activated carbon:</strong> Made from groundnut shells.</li>
            <li><strong>Bio-fuel:</strong> Groundnut shells are used as a renewable energy source.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Groundnuts are also rich in vitamins and minerals, and contain antioxidants that may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

        <h2>Common Diseases</h2>
        <p>Groundnut crops can be affected by a variety of diseases, including viral, fungal, bacterial, and nematode diseases.</p>

        <h3>Viral Diseases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bud necrosis disease:</strong> Caused by the groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV), which is transmitted by thrips. This disease causes the terminal bud to die, which can lead to significant economic losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato spotted wilt virus:</strong> Causes bud necrosis disease in groundnut, which can lead to severe yield losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fungal Diseases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stem rot:</strong> Caused by the fungus Sclerotium rolfsii, which can cause the stem of the groundnut plant to rot and die.</li>
            <li><strong>Early leaf spot:</strong> Caused by the fungus Cercospora arachidicola.</li>
            <li><strong>Late leaf spot:</strong> Caused by the fungus Phaeoisariopsis personata, also known as "tikka disease."</li>
            <li><strong>Sclerotinia blight:</strong> Caused by the soil-borne fungi Sclerotinia minor and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bacterial Diseases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bacterial wilt:</strong> Caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nematode Diseases</h3>
        <p>Root-knot nematodes, root lesion nematodes, ring nematodes, sting nematodes, and testa nematodes.</p>

        <h3>Other Diseases</h3>
        <p>Rust, collar rot, aflaroot, pod rot, and Alternaria leaf spot.</p>

        <h2>Pesticides and Fertilizers</h2>
        <p>Pesticides used for groundnut crops include herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides.</p>

        <h3>Herbicides</h3>
