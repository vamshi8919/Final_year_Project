        <h2>Pesticides and Fertilizers</h2>
        <h3>Fertilizers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers:</strong> Urea (46-0-0), Ammonium Nitrate (34-0-0), or Ammonium Sulfate (21-0-0) promote leafy growth and fruiting.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Phosphorus-rich fertilizers:</strong> Single Super Phosphate (0-16-0) or Triple Super Phosphate (0-46-0) enhance root development, flower formation, and fruiting.</li>

                    <li>Strobilurins (e.g., azoxystrobin)</li>
                    <li>Copper-based products</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Crop rotation:</strong> Rotate bitter gourd with other crops to break disease and pest cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Sanitation:</strong> Remove weeds, debris, and infested plants to prevent pest spread.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Biological control:</strong> Encourage natural predators, like ladybugs and lacewings, to control pests.</li>
