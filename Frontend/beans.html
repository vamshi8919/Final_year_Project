        <h2>Common Diseases</h2>
        <h3>Fungal Diseases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Powdery Mildew:</strong> Caused by Erysiphe polygoni, this disease covers leaves with a white, powdery growth, reducing photosynthesis.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Leaf Spot:</strong> Caused by Phoma exigua, this disease causes small, dark spots on leaves, leading to defoliation.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Root Rot:</strong> Caused by Pythium aphanidermatum, this disease leads to soft, rotting roots and plant death.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Fusarium Wilt:</strong> Caused by Fusarium oxysporum, this disease leads to yellowing leaves, wilting, and plant death.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bacterial Diseases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Bacterial Blight:</strong> Caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis, this disease causes small, dark spots on leaves and stems.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Common Bacterial Blight:</strong> Caused by Xanthomonas campestris, this disease causes small, dark spots on leaves and stems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Viral Diseases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Bean Common Mosaic Virus (BCMV):</strong> Caused by a virus, this disease leads to yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and distorted pods.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Bean Pod Mottle Virus (BPMV):</strong> Caused by a virus, this disease causes mottled, yellowing leaves and stunted growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Diseases:</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Management Strategies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Crop rotation:</strong> Rotate beans with other crops to break disease cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Sanitation:</strong> Remove weeds, debris, and infested plants to prevent disease spread.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Irrigation management:</strong> Avoid overwatering and ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Resistant varieties:</strong> Plant bean varieties with built-in resistance to diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Fungicides and bactericides:</strong> Use targeted fungicides and bactericides to control diseases.</li>

        <h2>Pesticides and Fertilizers</h2>
        <h3>Fertilizers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers:</strong> Urea (46-0-0), Ammonium Nitrate (34-0-0), or Ammonium Sulfate (21-0-0) promote leafy growth and pod formation.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Phosphorus-rich fertilizers:</strong> Single Super Phosphate (0-16-0) or Triple Super Phosphate (0-46-0) enhance root development, flower formation, and pod filling.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Potassium-rich fertilizers:</strong> Muriate of Potash (0-0-60) or Sulfate of Potash (0-0-50) promote overall plant health, resistance to disease, and pod quality.</li>

                    <li>Atrazine (selective)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Crop rotation:</strong> Rotate beans with other crops to break disease and pest cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Sanitation:</strong> Remove weeds, debris, and infested plants to prevent pest spread.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Biological control:</strong> Encourage natural predators, like ladybugs and lacewings, to control pests.</li>
